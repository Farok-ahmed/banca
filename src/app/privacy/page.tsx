                    This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose,

                  <h4>&nbsp;B. Personal Information&nbsp;</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Two types of personal information are protected by privacy
                    rights.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    The first is information that identifies a specific person
                    (alone or&nbsp;in combination with&nbsp;other information).
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    A person’s name is personal information if it is unique. An
                    individual’s name combined with a second piece of
                    information is an example of personal information if it is
                    not unique (and most people’s names are not). Home Address
                    Email Address Phone Number Social Media Identifier Age

                    The neighborhood the person lives in Where they went to
                    school and their medical history are examples of personally
                    identifiable information that when combined with a name or
                    other information can constitute a Personal Information
                    identifier.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Another type of protected personal information is
                    information of any personal nature about an identifiable
                    individual.
                  </p>
